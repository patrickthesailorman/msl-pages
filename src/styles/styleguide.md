### Sass CSS Preprocessor
The project uses Sass, a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. This project uses the SCSS syntax.

### KSS
KSS is a set of guidelines to help you produce an HTML styleguide tied to CSS documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be automatically extracted and processed by a machine. It is designed with CSS preprocessors (such as SCSS or LESS) in mind, and flexible enough to accommodate a multitude of CSS frameworks (such as YUI, Blueprint or 960).
